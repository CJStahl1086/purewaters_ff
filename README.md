# purewaters_ff

Purewaters_ff is a life-long passion project dedicated to tracking and recording my fly fishing adventures.  As my adventures and analytical capabilities continue to grow, it has utlimately reached a point that it would be a disservice to not document these pursuits.  The following is an outline of my strategies to take my adventures to the next level, as I document my attempts to target some of the wildest, remote, and rugged watersheds in the US (and hopefully the world) for some of the rarest trout species.  


1) Gathering the relevant data- OpenWeather API and the National Water Information System will be used to collect and record some of the river and weather conditions in which I fish. 

2) Databases- Once the data has been retrieval is recorded, it will be automatically update to an SQLite database and extracted for further analysis. 

3) Leveraging spatial data with Esri products- These two APIs include spatially based data, making it possible to utilize ArcGIS for visualization purposes.  As I continue to learn ArcGIS, recording conditions and waterways fished with ArcGIS will be critical to evaluating results, experiences, and targeting remote watersheds.

4) Communication of results-Using BlueHost, a wordpress based host, I will be (eventually) providing documentation such as maps, pictures, data, and an analysis of some of my adventures.
