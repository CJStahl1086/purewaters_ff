Creating a program that updates a database with current river and weather conditions to be viewed in ArcGIS maps for a bluehost website.

River conditions (flow and depth) and produced with the NWIS API and USGS gauges.
Weather conditions are determined by the OpenWeather API.  

Data is to be insterted into a postgres database
Database will be uploaded to ArcGIS to visualize spatial data.
Layers will be added to the GIS map to display NF roads, trout species, and tributaries.
Map will be embedded into a bluehost website.
